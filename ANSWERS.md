In Jest, what are the differences between describe() and it() globals, and what are good uses for them?

Using describe() allows you to break up our test suite's into easily read bricks/components that test individual aspects of the application. Using it() allows individual tests to be ran in order to prevent unforeseen bugs.



What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you think about this approach?

Test Driven Development utilizes a test first approach to creating an application. Tests are written prior to the application being created as a means of dictating how an application will run before it is created. I think tests are necessary to create an application that can continue to grow and combat unexpected bugs and errors.


Mention three types of automated tests.

Unit Testing, API testing, and regression testing.
